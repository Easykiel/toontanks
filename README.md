# ToonTanks Source Code

Hello! My name is EJ Protacio and this is my Fourth Gamedev Project that I learned from a Udemy Course called Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer: Learn C++ & Make Video Games by Ben Tristem. Most of the code is written by the course but I did create more Child classes such as the HomingTank and the HomingProjectile classes to add some uniqueness to my project. 

This is all of the C++ source code and features the Parent classes for the Pawns and Projectile as well as their derived Child Classes such as the Tank and Turret Classes.
